      This is a small section from a very large process map. It was developed to understand the existing way of doing things in the case-work team, as well as engage with the team themselves. It was later used to identify pain-points and potential opportunities.

      It was later used by the Syrian refugee resettlement team as a training tool, as well as being requested as a template model for several other prtojects across the Home Office.

      The process map was later used as a basis for understanding and mapping Activities, Needs, Goals and Barriers of key potential users of the service.

      It was the basis of the work to understand 6 main areas opportunity to be able to propose 3 different scope sizes of the project to the stakeholders, so they could decide on which areas of the process to focus on first.

      A big win was being able to digitise certain amounts of refugee group data and then tying that to the relevant documentation.

      Also being able to automate the case to get passed from one area of the case-work process to the next and be able to track this.

      A big challenge was working out and testing how to design a case-working system that the resettlement team could understand intuitively by following a uniform sequence of events.

      It was desirable to follow the basic structure of the resettlement process, whilst discarding any redundant methods.

      This project required constant user research and user testing with the resettlement team as the process used were extremely complex and inter-dependant with may other processes.

      I developed a concept for the process to interact with all the third party organisations that provided crucial data, health checks and security checks.

      It was very important to maintain the privacy of the refugee data and keep it locked behind the Home Office network.

      Third-party organisations are given log-ins and notified by email of cases to process and then upload the results directing into the service as data.

This is the main project that I’ve worked on at the Home Office. We worked with the Syrian refugee resettlement team to develop a digital case-working tool to aid them in resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees out-of-country.. The main focus was on digitising the case-work process to improve efficiency in quality case consideration, as well as the time taken to do this and creating useful management information statistics.

**Tasks include:**
Process mapping the existing way of doing things and identifying pain-points through user research. Service design principles were used to focus on Activities, Needs, Goals and Barriers of key potential users of the service. This was synthesised into 6 areas opportunity and develope to propose 3 different scope sizes of the project to the stakeholders. I designed user journeys, screen interactions and UI for the new digital service. I created paper & digital prototypes which were user-tested with the resettlement team.

**Intended Outcomes:**
The Syrian resettlement team’s aim is to bring refugees identified as vulnerable by UNHCR into the UK as defined by current government policy. The current process is slow and error-prone. We are trying to improve the process and create efficiencies by digitising the process and using raw data to re-format and share with 3rd party organisations.
