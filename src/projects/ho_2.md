      I designed this simple process diagram to communicate exactly what the brief was.

      I am a fan of clear communication and everyone in the team and stakeholders having a clear picture of the task at hand.

      This process map was used to show how the user information flowed. It was also simplified to help the main stakeholder understand the proposal.

      This is the landing page for the service. There was a lot of effort put into the content design and the layout in order to make it as simple and straight-forward as possible.

      The user selects their local council area. Since this service is a trial, there are only a certain number of councils currently signed up.

      The hope is that it works so well, it can be used as a proof-of-concept for rolling it out to many other councils in the UK.

      When the council has published their list of requested donations and services, the public can then choose what they’d like to offer.

      The published list is editable and the council can also add new sections.

Due to a high level of public interest and concern, we were tasked with developing a trial online solution to help members of the public find out how and what kind of help to be able to offered to refugees.

User research identified that councils enrolled in the trial project needed a way to tell the public what they wanted to help their newly arrived refugees, rather than receive lots of things that they didn’t need.

I designed a system where the council has a log in, then a check list of items or services to select, which they can then publish to the public Gov.uk website. The public select their local area on the website, view the list of requested donations, check off what they’d like to offer on the list, leave their contact details and the council will contact them to arrange for delivery of the items or services.

**Tasks included:**
Identifying pain-points of the councils enrolled in the trial project, through user research and understanding the best approach. Designing and process mapping a proposed approach to present to the stakeholders. Designing UX, interactions and UI for the new digital service. Building and user-testing the digital prototypes.

**Outcomes:**
Since launching in late July the service has already had over 900 offers. Councils and associated organisations now have an effective way to manage the offers of public help by publishing the things they want, rather than receiving the things they don’t need.
