I worked on a number of digital annual reports for some major corporations, using a lot of rich-media and animated
infographics to spice up this usually boring subject.

**Tasks included:** UI design and layout for digital annual reports. Laying out large quantities of 
content and managing changes through graphic specification documentation - the brand guideline 
specifications were made at the same time as the design, working closely with the clients to allow close cooperation and project visibility.

I also worked a promotional website for Vi-Spring, a company making bespoke beds.

**Tasks included:** UI design and layout for high end content using a rich media experience. Again, using 
the same approach of creating brand documentation as the project developed.
