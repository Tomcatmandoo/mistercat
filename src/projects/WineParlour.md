Commission by boutique wine specialists Chix & Buck to create a compelling and sophisticated design for the exterior of their first wine shop/wine bar located in Brixton. The brief was to set the scene for a unique wine experience by creating a charistmatic, yet clean and simple identity through the use of typography.

Brand guidelines creation for the use of logos, fonts, colours, spacing and imagery. From there I designed the wine labels, as well as illustrating the label image. Template design for the menus, generic wine labels and shelf labels so that the business was easily able update the changing content.

Website design, consulted on the content structure and art direction of 2 photo shoots to provide bespoke image collateral for the business to use for the website and other promotional material.
