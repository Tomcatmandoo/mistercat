      My direction for the website content was to lean towards the experience, the story of the company, the day-to-day blog, tastings and courses.

I was commissioned by boutique wine specialists Chix & Buck to create a compelling and sophisticated design for the exterior of their first wine shop/wine bar located in Brixton. The brief was to set the scene for a unique wine experience by creating a charistmatic, yet clean and simple identity through the use of typography.

I also created brand guidelines for the use of logos, fonts, colours, spacing and imagery. From there I designed the wine labels, as well as illustrating the label image. I made templates for the menus, generic wine labels and shelf labels so that the business was easily able update the changing content.

I designed the website, consulted on the content structure and art directed 2 photo shoots to provide bespoke image collateral for the business to use for the website and other promotional material.
