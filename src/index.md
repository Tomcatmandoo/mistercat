Iâ€™m a highly organised creative with strong user-centred design skills. With 22 years of digital design experience, I bring together interaction, UI and UX design knowledge. Over the last few years I have adopted service design principles into my practice and consider user research a crucial step in the design process.

I have 11 years of interaction, UI and UX design experience within agile web and software development. Previous to that I worked for several years within digital advertising as an art director. 

I have considerable experience with client presentation, team facilitation and always strive for clear communication. I also maintain an existing artistic practice of drawing, painting and printmaking.
