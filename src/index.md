Iâ€™m a highly organised creative with strong user-centred design skills. I have 20 years of digital design experience, bringing together interaction, UI and UX design knowledge. Over the last few years I have been adopting service design principles into my practice and I maintain a user-focused design approach promoting usability and accessibility as a starting point.

I have 10 years of interaction, UI and UX design experience within agile web and software development. Previous to that I worked for several years within digital advertising as an art director.

I have considerable experience with client presentation, team facilitation and always strive for clear communication. I also have a high competency of traditional art practice; drawing, painting and printmaking.
